# Hotel-Management-System
#Problem Statement: 
To book hotel rooms and handle bookings, the existing manual reservation system relies on paper and direct human involvement. This causes delays in the hotel while transmitting the information. This project intends to make it easier for hotel businesses to manage their activities by addressing issues that customers and hotel management confront. This project intends to provide software that will benefit both customers and hotel management.
